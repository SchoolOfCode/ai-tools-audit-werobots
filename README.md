# TechForge: AI Audit

The client, TechForge Industries, is a leading software development company. They are 250 people strong and they want our help to rapidly evaluate the AI landscape, and see what tools they should be thinking about as options to enhance their tech team experience, productivity, and as always leading to increasing end-customer value.

The AI landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. New tools are popping up daily, each promising to revolutionise how we work. They don't know which tools are worth adopting, which are not going to make much of an impact, and which could potentially pose risks to their operations.


# 

TechForge provides tailor-made software solutions to businesses, focusing on addressing unique client needs. They cater to industries like finance, healthcare, logistics, and retail, where custom systems for data management, automation, or customer interactions are critical.

Some of the challenges they face include:

- Customization Costs: High customization can drive up costs, and some clients may hesitate due to budget constraints.

- Long Sales Cycle: Custom software development often involves lengthy negotiations and onboarding, which slows down     revenue realization.

- Boosting emmployee productivity

By evaluating the different AI tools currently on the market, we have recommended the following 3 to address the challenges faced by TechForge.

## Benefits
- Allows users to search databases using natural language to receive AI-powered responses.
- Data is automatically analysed to established trends, anomalies and correlations.
- The built-in algorithms and parameters can be tuned to support the users needs.
- The visualisation of search queries provides an easy way for non-technical users to view data.
- Data + visualisations can be exported to PDF, CSV and XLSX.
- Monitor key business metrics with AI proactively pushing new insights.
- Can be integrated to live-query common cloud data platforms.

## Drawbacks
- $30,000 Annually could be quite expensive for the business (Pro plan required due to TechForge's 250 employee count).
- Initial setup and configuration requires a steep learning curve, and users may need additional training to become comfortable with the tool.
- The visualization features are reportedly lacking; restricting the ability to customise the look and feel of dashboards and reports.
- ThoughtSpot can struggle to handle more complex search queries.
- 

## Security
Essential security controls include data encryption in transit, disk-level data encryption at rest.

Standard security controls adds single sign-on via SAML/OAuth and row-level security.

Enterprise security controls adds advanced, granular data encryption at rest down to the database, folder or file level, as well as private communication link between ThoughtSpot and the data platform sources

# AI Tool: Zapier

Zapier is an automation tool that allows us to connect different apps and automate repetitive tasks without needing to write any code. This is particularly valuable for TechForge, where we often handle complex workflows across multiple tools for our clients. With Zapier, we can automate tasks like data transfers, notifications, and integrations between software applications with minimal effort.

The key opportunities Zapier offers TechForge are:
Cost-effective automation – Instead of custom coding every integration, we can use Zapier to quickly set up workflows, cutting down on development costs.
Time savings – Automating routine tasks will free up valuable time for our teams, allowing us to focus on more strategic work.
Increased productivity – Zapier empowers non-technical staff to create and manage their own automations, reducing the dependency on developers and speeding up our processes.


However, some of the  potential risks are:
Limited customization – While Zapier is great for simple workflows, it may not meet the needs of clients requiring more tailored solutions.
Data security – Since Zapier processes data between apps, it’s important to ensure that any workflows involving sensitive information comply with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.


When it comes to tangible benefits, Zapier helps reduce both development costs and the time spent on repetitive tasks. This translates to higher productivity and faster turnaround times for our clients, especially those with smaller budgets.
In conclusion, I would recommend adopting Zapier, particularly for smaller clients or internal automations where it can bring quick wins. While it has limitations for more complex projects, the cost and time savings make it a valuable tool for automating simpler tasks and enhancing efficiency.

# AI Tool: Salesforce Einstein

Shifting to a Salesforce CRM with it's integrated AI Einstein could significantly shorten sales cycles by making data-driven decisions and automate mundane processes.

With Einstein, you can prioritise leads by scoring them based on previous history allowing you to focus on leads that will actually convert. Einstein's generative AI can customise customer outreach by tailoring communication to increase customer engagement.

It is highly customisable with criteria that can be altered and tailored to terget specific customer needs whilst boosting productivity by automating basic tasks such as emails, meeting set ups as well as basic client qualifying.

With the use of NLP (Natural angyage Processing), Einstein can analyse feedback to detect trends in general dissatisfaction or issues to point out bugs or user friendliness enghancements.

They have a 0 data retention agreement to minimise data leaks when using client information during generation of emails as well as tools to check levels of what they call 'toxicity' to prevent hallucinations or inapporpriate generation.

Althought it does provide extensive documentation, there is a steep learning curve to consider which may delay enrollment or the ability to take full advantage immediately.

Overall, the way it can be used to automate most mundane processses and prioritise leads will allow you to shorten sales cycles by increasing lead conversion leading to a spike in revenue.
